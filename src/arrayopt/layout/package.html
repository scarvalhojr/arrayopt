<P>Provides implementation of heuristic placement algorithms.</P>

<P>This package contains heuristic algorithms that attempt to find a layout (the location of the probes on the chip) that minimize the occurrence of unintended illumination problems that can occur during the production of microarrays. The algorithms also try to improve the quality of the chips by finding better embeddings of the probes into the deposition sequence.</P>
